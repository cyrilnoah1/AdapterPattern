The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class
into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets
classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

In this example, we make use of the Adapter Pattern, to
cook Upma from Idli. Here, the already prepared Idli is sent to
the Idli-Upma Adapter, and the rest of the process is carried out inside
it, to finally produce Upma made from Idli.
